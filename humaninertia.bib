abstract = {Quantitative mechanical analyses of human movement require the time histories of the angles which specify body configuration and orientation. When these angles are obtained from a filmed performance they may be used to evaluate the accuracy of a simulation model. This paper presents a method of determining orientation angles and their rates of change from film data. The stages used comprise the synchronization of data obtained from two camera views, the determination of three-dimensional coordinates of joint centres, the calculation of an angle from a sequence of sine and cosine values and the curve fitting of angles using quintic splines. For each stage, other possible approaches are discussed. Original procedures are presented for obtaining individual error estimates of both the film data and the calculated angles to permit the automatic fitting of quintic splines for interpolation and differentiation and for deriving the time history of an angle as a continuous function from a sequence of sine and cosine values. The method is applied to a forward somersault with 1 1/2 twists and the average error estimate of 17 orientation angles is obtained as 2.1 degrees.},

abstract = {A computer simulation model of human airborne movement is described. The body is modelled as 11 rigid linked segments with 17 degrees of freedom which are chosen with a view to modelling twisting somersaults. The accuracy of the model is evaluated by comparing the simulation values of the angles describing somersault, tilt and twist with the corresponding values obtained from film data of nine twisting somersaults. The maximum deviations between simulation and film are found to be 0.04 revolutions for somersault, seven degrees for tilt and 0.12 revolutions for twist. It is shown that anthropometric measurement errors, from which segmental inertia parameters are calculated, have a small effect on a simulation, whereas film digitization errors can account for a substantial part of the deviation between simulation and film values.},

abstract = {A mathematical inertia model which permits the determination of personalized segmental inertia parameter values from anthropometric measurements is described. The human body is modelled using 40 geometric solids which are specified by 95 anthropometric measurements. A 'stadium' solid is introduced for modelling the torso segments using perimeter and width measurements. This procedure is more accurate than the use of elliptical discs of given width and depth and permits a smaller number of such solids to be used. Inertia parameter values may be obtained for body models of up to 20 segments. Errors in total body mass estimates from this and other models are discussed with reference to the unknown lung volumes.},

abstract = {A method is presented for determining the angular momentum of the human body about its mass centre for general three-dimensional movements. The body is modelled as an 11 segment link system with 17 rotational degrees of freedom and the angular momentum of the body is derived as a sum of 12 terms, each of which is a vector function of just one angular velocity. This partitioning of the angular momentum vector gives the contribution due to the relative segmental movement at each joint rather than the usual contribution of each segment. A method of normalizing the angular momentum is introduced to enable the comparison of rotational movements which have different flight times and are performed by athletes with differing inertia parameters. Angular momentum estimates were calculated during the flight phases of nine twisting somersaults performed on trampoline. Errors in film digitization made large contributions to the angular momentum error estimates. For individual angular momentum estimates the relative error is estimated to be about 10\% whereas for mean angular momentum estimates the relative error is estimated to be about 1\%.},

abstract = {This paper documents the physical measurements of the Korean population in order to construct a data base for ergonomic design. The dimension, volume, density, mass, and center of mass of Koreans whose ages range from 7 to 49 were investigated. Sixty-five male subjects and sixty-nine female subjects participated. Eight body segments (head with neck, trunk, thigh, shank, foot, upper arm, forearm and hand) were directly measured with a Martin-type anthropometer, and the immersion method was adopted to measure the volume of body segments. After this, densities were computed by the density equations in Drillis and Contini (1966). The reaction board method was employed for the measurement of the center of mass. Obtained data were compared with the results in the literature. The results in this paper showed different features on body segment parameters comparing with the results in the literature. The constructed data base can be applied to statistical guideline for product design, workspace design, design of clothing and tools, furniture design and construction of biomechanical models for Korean. Also, they can be extended to the application areas for Mongolian.},
