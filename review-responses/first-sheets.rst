Dear Alison L. Sheets,

Thank you for your time and expertise in this review and we are happy that you
have approved with minor revisions. You had one specific concern in your
review:

   My only minor suggestion is for the authors to add definitions for terms in
   Figure 4 that are not self-descriptive. For example, it is not clear what
   rel_center_of_mass and rel_inertia are defined relative to.

We have updated the text to clarify what these methods names mean and how we
define the word "relative". Also note that the docstrings for these methods
explain that these produce the inertial properties relative to the segment's
local coordinate system. For example see:

Sincerely,

Chris Dembia, Jason K. Moore, and Mont Hubbard
