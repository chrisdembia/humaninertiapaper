Dear Alison L. Sheets,

Thank you for time and expertise in this review and we are happy that you have
approved with minor revisions.

   My only minor suggestion is for the authors to add definitions for terms in
   Figure 4 that are not self-descriptive. For example, it is not clear what
   rel_center_of_mass and rel_inertia are defined relative to.

We have updated the text to clarify what relative means.

Sincerely,

Chris Dembia, Jason K. Moore, and Mont Hubbard
