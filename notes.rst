Title: Object oriented implementation of Yeadon's human inertial model

Introduction
============

- What human inertia calcs are
- Why you need them
- How people use them
- How they obtain
- Review of existing software
- Winter text book on biomechanics (compare height and mass)
- Intro to Yeadon's model and citations to him.
- Why we use Yeadon's model.

Find papers that use this model:
- Alison Sheet's work
- compare to her matlab code

Yeadon's Method
---------------

Brief explanation
FIGURE - measurements
FIGURE - cfg

Software Design
===============

- Utility
- proven advantage
- long term advantage
- mainenance and potential for growth
- algorithms
- object model (pylint may generate UML diagrams)
- modularity
- open source
- how does this software make it easy to integrate with anaylysis
- software license

Validation - chris
==========

- demonstrate that it achvies purpose
- prove improvement over existing
- proof of principle example
- Jason will look at diss but for now compare to Yeadon's code.
- Show comparison numeric tables.
- test data
- direct link

How to install the software
===========================

cross platform

How to use the software - chris
=======================
- Command line
- UI
- ??GUI!!
- show basic usage then a bigger example
- FIGURE spinning ice skater example
- input file format description
- code snippets

Example
=======

- (Results)
- Person sitting on bicycle.
- Reference the software where this is implemented.
- Show numerical numbers of benchamrk bicycle and then the examples after
- can we show something that goes beyond just calculating the numbers and the images?
- compare easy of generating inertia for different models (rigid rider vs multisegment rider)
